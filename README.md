# Conway's Game of Life in love2d

* `Left Click` - place cell, can hold
* `Right Click` - remove cell, can hold
* `Mouse Wheel Up/Down` - zoom in/out top left corner of screen (cause math is killing me already, I would appreciate if somebody would help me here)
* `C` - clear
* `Ctrl-C` - copy code
* `Ctrl-V` - paste code (replaces entire level)
* `Space` - pause/unpause
* `-` - decrease tick speed
* `=` - increase tick speed (it's equals cause that's the same key as +)

Tick Speed is how many ticks it waits for the next generation, Cell Size is how many pixels every cell is.
